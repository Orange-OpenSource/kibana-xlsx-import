### Define your own mapping and/or index name (optional)
```diff
- If you want to define your own mapping, you have to use an index name which doesn't already exist.
- Index name must be all lower case.
```

### Create a document ID with template  

To create a personnal ID per document you have to use a template with placeholder {fieldname}.  
In our example, if I use the following template `{ID}-{Last_name}-{First_name}` it will set for the first document:  
  - `0-Miller-Katrina`  

### Advanced settings  

In the kibana advanced setting you can find three parameters  
__Warning :__ All those options might cause crash if values are too high.  

  - `xlsx-import:bulk_package_size`  
  Allow you to define the number of json item you want to send per bulk package  
  
  - `xlsx-import:filesize_warning`  
  Define when the trigger for a larger file will appear (value in Mb)  
  
  - `xlsx-import:displayed_elements`  
  Define the number of elements which will be displayed in the preview datatable
