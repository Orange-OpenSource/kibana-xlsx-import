```diff
- If you want to define your own mapping, you have to use an index name which doesn't already exist.
- Index name must be all lower case.
```  
#### Use your own mapping  
For every field you can choose the type and apply more options with the advanced JSON.  
The list of parameters can be found here, https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.2/mapping-params.html

#### Use a custom Kibana ID
To create a custom Kibana ID with your field values you can use a template with placeholder {fieldname}.  
In our example, if I use the following template `{ID}-{Nom}` this will lead us to the following ID for the first document :
  - `1-Toto`

### You're done !  


### Advanced settings  

In the kibana advanced setting you can find those parameters  
__Warning :__ All those options might cause crash or slowing the plugin.  

  - `xlsx-import:bulk_package_size`  
  Allow you to define the number of json item you want to send per bulk package  

  - `xlsx-import:displayed_rows`  
  Define the number of rows which will be displayed in the preview
